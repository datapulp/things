here's the gist...

When you put text on a new line, as done here, it just hangs on to the previous line.



That is unless; because of the following:\

```

you add a backslash at the end of line \

you add a double space '  ' at the end of line

you double-line-space between lineA and lineB, so that there is a blank-line between lineA and lineB

you are typing inside a codeblock, like what you are reading right now, hence removing the need for multiline syntax.

```
