here's the gist...
When you put text on a new line, as done here (here's the gist is printed on row20, this current line row21, however; here we are...), it just hangs on to the previous line.



That is unless; because of the following:
```
you add a backslash at the end of line \
you add a double space '  ' at the end of line
you double-line-space between lineA and lineB, so that there is a blank-line between lineA and lineB
you are typing inside a codeblock, like what you are reading right now, hence removing the need for multiline syntax.

or, your next line is something unusual, like in this case, because your next line is a multiline_code-block
```
